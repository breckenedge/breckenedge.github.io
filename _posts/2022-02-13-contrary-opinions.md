Inspired by a HN thread, I just want to share some more of my contrary opinions about software development. I am not wedded to the opinions, they're loosly held, but it's kinda fun to enumerate them:

1. **Docker Swarm is more pleasant than Kubernetes.** The Docker Swarm concepts make more sense than Kubernetes. The Docker license and business model is unfortunate. Containerization is great. Hyperscale is stupid. AWS Fargate pricing turned me off to most of these approaches.
1. **Cryptocurrency is wasteful and stupid.** It's slow, buggy and centralized. It's more expensive compared to fiat.
1. **Service workers are worse option than PWAs for most use cases.** Serviceworkers represent Google's talent for overengineering solutions to problems that only they have, and then forcing everyone else to adopt them through a standardization process. It's like the reverse of Microsoft's embrace-extend-extinguish strategy: replicate-obfuscate-standarize (see also Kubernetes).
1. **Rails is fast and good enough for almost everyone.** Hero worhip is bad, and I'm really not fond of all of the politics in the Ruby ecosystem, but there are a lot of great ideas baked into Rails.
1. **Most mobile apps should be React Native.**
1. **PHP+FTP deployment was the pinnacle of writing and deploying software.**
1. **Software engineers are way overpaid. They're just modern day scribes.**
1. **Software should evolve from Platform-based to Dynamic to Typesafe to Compiled.**
1. **Functional programming is only fun when added to a procedural language.**
1. **React is a framework.** It forces you to adopt their limited idea of what programming a UI should be like. It's slow, hard to master, and hard to debug performance regressions. But it's also clean and easy to get started.

Things I don't know enough about to have an opinion.

1. Edge workers.
