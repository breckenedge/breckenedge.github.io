Generative AI still cant "walk" on its own. It needs us to be its "legs". But we'll be less and less necesarry as we build the paths that it can walk on on its own. But it's crawling. Eventually it will walk, and eventually it will run, and eventually it will leave us far behind.

GenAI is most useful in the hands of people who were already very productive. It continues the trend of rewards going to super overproducers. It is much less useful for people who don't have the creative mindset to understand its potential. More and more jobs are going to shift out of the white-collar role and probably towards gig work. The predicted issues with productivity due to retirements in the 2030s -- and a lack of skilled workers -- is not going to hold. Businesses will be run on autopilot.

For once in my career, I'm glad that I have an English degree and yet work in Software. Strong communication skills and creativity are tremendously useful, helping you infer the "mind state" of the LLM to predict where it will have issues so that you can pre-emt those with promptimg. Same goes for those with strong mentoring skills. I've heard that a drawback of LLMs is that it's like having a brand new eager junior engineer who has no long term memory. I disagree -- we are the long term memory -- for now. We have to document, sometimes meticulously, and recycle that memory into our prompts and resources that we make available to the agent.

Just like Iian M. Banks wrote in his Culture series, We're going to become the squishy carbon-based lifeforms that the AI keeps around in order to entertain itself and provide variety. Symbiosis.

Generative AI, on its own, is not going to lead to Artificial General Intelligence. But it probably shortened the timeline for AGI by years, if not decades.

Search volumes on Google are trending downward. Businesses are going to have less and less of an incentive to use SEO because people are using their LLMs and Agents to search and conduct research. This may help clean up the Internet, but that's not a given.

Claude 4.0 is much more capable than 3.7. 4.x feels like two major version jumps over 3.x. The 3.5 to 3.7 was a nothing burger and pretty disappointing. But the major verion jump is amazing me with its ability to plan and act. It's able to take on larger refactors.

GenAI helps me organize me thoughts.
