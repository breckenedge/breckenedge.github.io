It's been a year. This, of course, is a start of a blog, and I've been
struggling to come up with a topic to write about. I don't really think much
changes on New Years Day, but it's a convenient time to remember everything
that's changed in my life in the last twelve months, since it feels like a lot.

Things that I started doing in 2018:

- Teaching English at [Literacy Achieves][4].
- Grilling!
- Journaling regularly.
- Playing the Nintendo Switch.
- Learning French via [Duolingo][5] (My honeymoon starts in 76 days!)
- Standing at my [desk][6], again.

Things that I stopped doing in 2018:

- Flying airplanes. I miss it, but not enough to finish my IFR.
- Participating in the [Advent of Code][3]. Hopefully I can return in 2019, but
  2018 was just too busy.

Books that I finished in 2018:

- [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck][8]
- [Humboldt's Gift][9]
- [The Pragmatic Programmer][2]
- [Accelerate][7]
- [Crucial Confrontations][1]
