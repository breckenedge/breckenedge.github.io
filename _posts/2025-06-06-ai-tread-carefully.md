There's an abundance of excitement around using Generative AI, especially for software development. I find the recently-upgraded Anthropic Claude, v4, to be a pretty big leap in real productivity. The model much is less likely to fall into traps and does a better job staying on task.

But beware, not all engineering managers are convinced. Some may even see it as a harmful distraction. I don't think these managers are using evidence to make these judgements, but never-the-less, the judgements are still being made. Always try to get a sense of how they're interpreting what you share.

If you're someone who likes to share the newest AI news, and try to level up your team by demonstration, keep an eye on your manager. Always be reading the room.
