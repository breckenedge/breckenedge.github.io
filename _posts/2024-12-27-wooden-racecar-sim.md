I recently rearranged my home office and needed to replace a very bulk 2x4 based sim that I hacked together a few years ago. My goal was something that was lightweight and compact. In this previous sim, I had built a platform to mount an actual seat from a car (My 99 Z3), but real car seats are typically heavy, so this time I just decided to use a normal kitchen chair. The kitchen chair would be held in place by bracing it against the frame, preventing the chair from slipping while I mashed on the pedals. I have a cheap-ish Thrustmaster setup, so didn't feel like spending $100 or more on something from China. I also wanted to practice making a castle joint for the three-way intersection for the pedal mounts.

# Shopping List

- 2x 96" x 2" x 4" stud (actual 96" x 3-3/4" x 1-3/4")
- 1x 48" x 10" x 1" board (actual 48" x 9-1/4" x 3/4")

# Parts List

- 2x frame rails - 1-1/2" x 1-1/2" x 36"
- 4x pedal legs - 1-1/2" x 1-1/2" x 4"
- 1x pedal mount - 9-1/4" x 19-1/4" x 3/4"

# Cut List

## First 2x4 stud

1. Cut two (2) 29-1/2" lengths. These will be the wheel uprights. Rip these down to 1-1/2" x 3" x 29-1/2".
2. Cut one (1) 36" length. Rip this in half so that you have two (2) 1-1/2" x 1-1/2" x 36" for the frame rails.

## Second 2x4 stud

1. Cut one (1) 19-1/4" length. Rip this in half so that you have two (2) 1-1/2" x 1-1/2" x 19-1/4" for the frame braces.
2. Cut two (2) 6-1/2" lengths. Rip these in half so that you have four (4) 1-1/2" x 1-1/2" x 6-1/2" legs for the pedal mount.

## 48" x 10" x 1" board

1. Cut one (1) 19-1/4" x 9-1/4" for the pedal mount.
2. From the remaining board, rip it into two (2) 4" x 19-1/4" boards for the wheel mount boards.
